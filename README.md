# apprenticeship_Alarmsystem_FinalProject

This was my first coding project ever.

I was an apprentice and this was a project to showcase at an event for all apprentices.

I'm gonna be honest. It's really bad.

It was my first time coding in python, I learned everything from scratch with this project.

I don't even know if this still works.

Purpose of the program was relatively simple. It was a mock-Alarmsystem.
I physically built a simple architecture which used electronics like LEDs and Reed switches to trigger alarms.
Once a GPIO was hit, it would trigger an alarm, which basically meant the GUI blinks & changes.

It was a fun project, but it failed dramatically since I overestimated my time on this.

But yea... I figured I upload it, to archive it under my account.
Nothing to be proud of, just a bit of history.
